# Description

- The database consists of four tables: Doctors, Patients, Appointments, and Prescriptions. Patients can schedule one or more appointments with doctors, and each appointment may have one or more associated prescriptions.

- The system allows end users to add doctors, patients, appointments, and prescriptions. Additionally, users can filter or search for appointments based on criteria such as the doctor's name, patient's name, appointment date, or appointment time.
